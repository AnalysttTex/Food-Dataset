The food dataset contains total analysis on several food samples to determine the accurate measurements of different nutrients present.
Food nutrients spans general qualities such as cholesterol, total sugar as well as specific nutrients such as monosaturated fats, vitamin c etc.
This aided the eventual segregation of the entire dataset into 4 tables each containing specific type of food nutrients.
Three columns were used as pointers and for identification purposes thus are found in all 4 tables. They are the Category, Description and Nutrient Data Bank Number columns.
The latter contains a unique ID which was used as a primary and foreign key to link all 4 tables.
Data cleaning was partially done with Excel. The rest was done in SQL and can be found within the document 
This dataset proves to be useful in various ways; food recommendations with respect to different health issues, keeping tabs on various meals to ensure the absolute intake of balanced diet.
Please take your time to go through it. Reviews, complains and questions are always welcomed. Thanks
